    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Sophia Blitz</br>
      Founder. Owner. Instructor.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophia's teaching style evolved around the core value of respect-- for oneself, one's partner, and the community around. 
      Whether teaching a class or private lesson, she helps her students discover how to respect and connect with themselves, 
      their partner, and the music. Even Sophia's beginner classes are taught with advanced explanations so that students can 
      learn the underlying principles of how to lead and follow effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sophia's pedagogy is the product of 7+ years of regular social dancing (e.g. Salsa, Bachata, and Zouk), 5+ years of 
    competitive ballroom dancing, and a number of instructor training programs in Salsa, Bachata, and Zouk. Sophia's approach 
    to teaching dance emphasizes the experience of the dancers and dynamic nature of social dancing with a partner. By building 
    the acuity of your senses, you learn to listen and communicate more clearly and more kindly with your partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing that the fundamentals of partner dancing can apply beyond the dance floor, Sophia layers life lessons 
      into her dance classes. Many of her students have found that taking dance classes with Sophia can offer lessons in 
      much more than just dance. What can an improved connection do for your experience of dancing? What about for your 
      experience of life?

      Connection. Dance for it. Live for it.</p>
