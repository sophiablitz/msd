# Where you able to create the exercise on your own?
I completed the tasks before thoroughly reading the textbook.
 - Are counters independent: I didn't understand the idea that each invocation of the function makeCounter created a new lexical environment. I ran the code to see the output and looked at the solution to understand the behavior.
 - Counter Object: I was able to predict the behavior correctly. I ran the code and it did what I expected, the two methods of Counter shared the same lexical environment and therefor refered to the same counter variable. 
 - Function in if: I did not answer correctly. I ran the code and looked at the solution. 
 - Sum with closures: 
# Do you have any quesitons or concepts/solutions you want explained?
I'm not solid on my understanding the rules of how a lexical environment is defined. 

# Comment on something that was interesting or that you learned from the lab. 

# Did you have sufficient time to finish the assignment?
Yes I had sufficient time to finish the assignment, mostly in class. 

# How long did it take?
fewer hours than the hours I was in class (4.5), as I completed it in class. 
Likely around 1-2 hrs of straight coding time.
