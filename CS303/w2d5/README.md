# Where you able to create the exercise on your own?
Recursion exercises: Yes

printNumbers with setInterval: yes
printNumbers with setTimeout: yes, with refering to the example in the book calling a named function expression

what will setTimeout show?: Only after reading the solution and the textbook did I recognize that the callback of a setTimeout will only be called after the current script is finished running.

# Do you have any questions or concepts/solutions you want explained?
I don't understand what the extra credit problem is looking for and would like to see a solution. I wrote a caching version of a recursive Fibonacci function. I don't think that's what was asked.

# Comment on something that was interesting or that you learned from the lab. 
The callback of a setTimeout will only be called after the current script is finished running.

# Did you have sufficient time to finish the assignment?
Yes I had sufficient time to finish the assignment, mostly in class. 

# How long did it take?
A few hours, mostly in class.
