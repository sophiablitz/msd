I was able to complete all of the exercises without looking at solutions

I enjoyed working out a fast recursive solution to the fibonacci problem. Although it is essentially a loop, it handles the same process of calculating each step based on the previous. 

I was able to complete all exercises from Part 1 during class time. I was already familiar with recursion and had already written solutions to Fibonacci multiple times over the last 9 years. In working on it this time, I created the slow recursive approach quickly, the loop version quickly, and then had to really focus to work out the recursive approach that mimics the loop -- i remembered from past experience that the function took multiple parameters, but couldn't remember exactly how the function worked. This was enough of a start to work through it.

I spent a few minutes tweaking and adding documentation for my part II code after class.
