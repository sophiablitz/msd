# Where you able to create the exercise on your own?
 - Working With Prototype: I misread the code and therefore incorrectly answered the third part. Upon checking the output and then rereading the code, I immediately understood my mistake. I thought the property 'jump' of object 'rabbit' was called to be deleted a second time, but actually the call was to delete the property 'jump' of 'animal'.
 - Searching Algorithm: yes, easy, quick. I used to the solution as an explanation for why the two different ways of accessing a property don't have different performance results.
 - Where it writes?: yes, easy, quick, no solution neede
 - Why two hamsters are full?: yes, it was helpful to view the solution as an alternative implementation and read about the other comments in the thread.
  - OBJECTS, THE BASICS: CONSTRUCTOR - OPERATOR 'NEW' TASKS: already did during week 1.
